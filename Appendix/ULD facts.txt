"ULDs vary in height from 1.7 m for lower deck, through 2.4 m for the main deck, to 3.0 m for fully contoured, these dimensions determining the rack spacing required for storing them. Consignment storage is usually in one metre cubes of racking fed by fork lift or by automatic storage/retrieval systems as employed in supermarket warehouses. They may extend to 20 units high by 30 long by 14 deep, to give 1000 cubic metres.
