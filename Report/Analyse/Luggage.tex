\section{Luggage}
Luggage is brought on the plane by the use of tugs which will transport containers with baggage. The Boing 747 have seats for 416 passengers(http://alturl.com/w7bfj) and would carry roughly 6500kg of baggage. 9568 kg if plane would be entirely booked and every passenger had a 23kg checked baggage, and in this estimate, the hand baggage is not taken into account. To transport such an amount of baggage, tied planning and careful transport is necessary in order to bring the baggage on the airplane in a timely fashion.


Novia and SAS Ground Handling are two handling companies that has the responsibility for loading the luggage(http://alturl.com/y9jcc). If a passengers luggage is by a mistake sent with a wrong plane, the passenger can contact the airline company, and then they will talk with the ground handling company they have hired. In Aalborg Lufthavn, baggage is equipped with a little electronic chip that allows the airport to track the luggage.
