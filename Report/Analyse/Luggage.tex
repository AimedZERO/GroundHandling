\section{Luggage}
Luggage is loaded on the plane using tugs, which transport containers with luggage. The Boeing 747 has seats for 416 passengers(http://alturl.com/w7bfj) and can carry roughly 6,500 kg of luggage. %Nedenstående kommer ude af sammenhæng - eller det er MEGET svært at vide hvad der menes
9,568 kg if plane would be entirely booked and every passenger had a 23 kg checked luggage, and in this estimate, the hand luggage is not taken into account. To transport such an amount of luggage, tied planning and careful transport is necessary in order to bring the luggage on the airplane in a timely fashion. %Ovenover - "tied planning", hvad menes?


Novia and SAS Ground Handling are two ground handling companies that have the responsibility of loading luggage(http://alturl.com/y9jcc). If a passenger's luggage is, by mistake, sent with a wrong plane, the passenger can contact the airline company, and then they will talk with the ground handling company, that handled the luggage. In Aalborg Lufthavn, luggage is equipped with a RFID chip that allows the airport to track the luggage, so as to make it easier to locate lost luggage.
