Tom Mochal who is president of TenStep http://www.tenstep.com/open/miscpages/90.11ContactTenStep.html says that one of the major things that can make projects fail or take longer time than needed, is the way that not all job are defined as good as they could be http://www.techrepublic.com/article/poor-planning-is-project-management-mistake-number-one/. One way you could make this more clear to the people working on the prject or job, is to give them a PDA, smarthone or tablet, and wirte out the job on the device, to make sure that they have understood the job properly.

Another thing that you could do, was giving people the first 15 minutes of a day to make sure that they had properly understodd all the tasks that they where to do that day.
