\section{Supervisors}
The supervisors to the ground handling teams are very important stakeholders to consider, when developing programs which apply to ground handlers.

The supervisors have to direct the ground handlers effectively, and also monitor their performance level. Therefore it is the supervisors, who bear the main responsibility if the program is ineffective or decreasing performance. If the program should be any of the aforementioned, the supervisors probably have the biggest say in deciding whether to terminate the use of the program or not.

For the program to be most relevant for the supervisors, it should be designed with features that ease or simplify the workload of the supervisors. That could be features like motivating the workers, dynamically allocating tasks among the workers and/or making performance evaluation reports easily available to the supervisor.
