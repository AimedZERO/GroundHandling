\section{Problem statement}

Handeling companies often hire low-paid workers who work in an enviorment where they are exposed to congestion, stress, noise, jet-blast, extremes of weather and sometimes to low visibility conditions. Stress is a very big part of the work in an airport especially for the Ground Handlers since airlines don't make money while the aircraft is not in the air.  In many places it is also the workers who are responseble for delays and will a delay will result a salarydeduction.

When a worker is stressed he makes mistakes wich leads accidents. These accidents can first and foremost become dengerous for the workers because they can be hurt as a result of an accident. A survey made by ACI in 2004 showed that out of 15,119,020 aircraft movements 3,233 had accidents resulting in 0.214% of all turnovers had accidents.

Accidents do not only lead to dangerous situations for the workers but can also become very expensive for the companies first of all because of the cost of the repair but also because the airplane will then have to spend more time on the ground and not make money by flying.


Most of the delays and errors that happen to airoplanes are caused by the ground handlers, who service the planes. Is it possible to reduce stressfactors and optimize performance for ground handlers, by making an information system, that can dynamically manage ground handlers' tasks throughout the day?
