Most of the delays and errors that happen to aeroplanes are caused by the ground handlers,
who service the planes. Is it possible to reduce stressfactors and optimize performance for
ground handlers, by making an information system, that can dynamically manage ground
handlersâ€™ tasks throughout the day?

Human errors and accidents during a turn-round is a result of stressed and unmotivated employees, causing delays, damage to equipment, loss of airtime* and other unwanted annoyances for airlines and ground handling providers. Is it possible to formulate a software solution to resolve these issues by dynamically adapting to non-scheduled situations?
