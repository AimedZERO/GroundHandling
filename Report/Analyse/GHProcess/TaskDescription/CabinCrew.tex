\subsection{Cabin Crew}
In this section the focus will be put on which tasks and responsibilities the cabin crew takes on. 

Ahead of each flight, the entire flight crew are required to show up to a briefing about the flight.

At the briefing, the crew undergoes the safety protocols, emergency check lists, the targeted flight location, and how much safety equipment are on board the flight. The flight personal is in charge of boarding V.I.P. passengers, families with small kids, and passengers with special needs.

Once a airplane has taken off, the crew serves food and drinks to the passengers and personal. While they serve, it is their responsibility to periodically conduct cabin checks and listen for any unusual noises. They additionally have to perform periodic checks on the lavatories, here the crew investigates the mandatory ashtray and if smoke detectors have been tampered with as well as restocking the lavatories. In addition, the cockpit needs to be checked regularly to ensure the pilot's health and safety. Before each landing, the crew gathers food trays and rubbish to be disposed before the final landing procedure is initiated, fastening all loose items and a final cabin check is performed. 


In summary the cabin crew needs a specific briefing before take off, and during the flight the crew will check the state of the airplanes safety.
