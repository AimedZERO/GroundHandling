\section{Management}
In this section the management, those responsible for administrating the ground handlers, will be described. The management part of the organisation is essential to keep the whole operation running. Here it will be described how managers works and what tools they are using and, possibly, are missing.
\subsection{Supervisors}
In this section the focus will be put on the supervisors of the ground handling teams, because they are very important stakeholders to consider when developing programs which apply to ground handlers.

The supervisors have to direct the ground handlers effectively, and monitor their performance level. Therefore it is the supervisors, who bear the main responsibility if the program is ineffective or decreases worker performance. If the program should be any of the aforementioned, the supervisors have the biggest say in deciding whether to terminate the use of the program or not.

For the program to be most relevant for the supervisors, it should be designed with features that ease or simplify the workload of the supervisors. This could be features like making it easier to motivate the workers, dynamically allocating tasks among the workers and making performance evaluation reports easily available to the supervisor.

An important aspect about supervisors, is that they need access to information that is relevant to them, but not the ground handlers.
