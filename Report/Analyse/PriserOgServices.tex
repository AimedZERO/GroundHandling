\section{Prices and services}

Fuel is an important part of Ground Handling since it is rquired to make aircrafts fly. Aalborg Airport has an agreement with the Shell corporation to get their fuel supply from them. The fuel that is used is called 100LL, and is a very common aircraft fuel, it is priced at 19.85 kr/liter, whcih means that if you would have to fill up a boeing 737-800, which can contain 26,020 liters, it would cost 516,497 kr. + the atartup fee.

As described above you can see that there is a lot of money going around in an airport just when you take 1 airplane into account. the airplanes need to get filled up a lot, since a filled up boeing 737-800 uses 3,200 liters of fuel pr hour it is in the sky. This means that if you where to fly from Aalborg to Copehagen it would cost, just in terms of fuel, 47,640 kr.
