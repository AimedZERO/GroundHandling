\item Purpose of the trip
	-The purpose of the trip was to get answers to some of our more difficult questions like "Does a given ground handling worker do more than one job, or are they specialized?" which turned out to be different from airport to airport. We also wanted to talk to a specialist in order to get a professional point of view  
on the subject.

\item Kim Bermann
	-We got to interview the COO of Aalborg airport Ground handling, which  
means he is in charge of IT-support, Facility, Cargo, Security and more. He  
answered all of our questions and gave us an presentation of the Airports  
development and his own career. 

\item Literature and other information sources
	-He also referred us to some literature such as the so called "Ground Handling  
Bible" in which information on all the different services can be found. This  
book will be incorporated in our project.

\item Tour
	-We were on a guided tour that took place at different places at the  
airport after our interview.

\subitem Baggage 
	-We were shown were the baggage sorting and distribution found place.  
We were also shown how they keep track of the baggage and other details.

\subitem Forward lower lobe
	-We were able to sand next to a plane that was getting loaded, and to  
see in which order the plane was loaded and handled. Beforehand we were unsure  
about what the forward lower lobe was, so it was nice that we had the  
opportunity to actually see it.

\subitem Sequence of task
	-We also in which order the different tasks was done in. As soon as the  
plane stood still it was hooked up with a cable that started to charge it, and  
soon after the passenger ramp arrived and so on.
